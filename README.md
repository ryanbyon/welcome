- **CS 61A - *The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*:**
    - The Game of Hog (*Python*): A simple simulator for the dice game Hog.
    - Yelp Maps (*Python*): A visualization of restaurant ratings near UC Berkeley using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset.
    - Ants Vs. SomeBees (*Python*): A tower defense game that is similar to and inspired by Plants Vs. Zombies.
    - Scheme Interpreter (*Python, Scheme*): An interpreter for a subset of Scheme language.
- **CS 61B - *Data Structures*:**
    - Data Structures (*Java*):
        - Part 1: Double-Ended-Queue data structures using both linked-list and arrays.
        - Part 2: Deque interface to solve some problems with words such as Palindrome.
    - Database (*Java, SQL*):
        - A small version of Database Management System(DBMS), as well as a Domain Specific Language(DSL) which a user can interact with the database.
    - Bear Maps (*Java*):
        - The backend of web mapping application which user can do following things: *scroll, zoom, getting direction*.
        - The backend takes in URL from browser and generate an image corresponding to a map of the region specified inside the URL being displayed by the front-end.
        - Quad-Tree data structure stores OpenStreetMap dataset(*Google*).
- **CS 61C - *Machine Structures*:**
    - Trie and Ternary Search Trees (*C*):
        - A dictionary of words using Trie and Ternary Search Tree data structures which user can add/remove/search words.
    - RISC-V Instruction Set Emulator (*C, RISC-V*):
        - An emulator that executes subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
    - CPU (*Logism*):
        - A simple 32-bit processor with an ISA that uses a subset of RISC-V instructions using Logism.
        - A single-cycle processor and two-stage pipelined processor versions.
    - Optimization (*C*):
        - A slower version of *numpy* that performs some matrix operations.
            - Given skeleton codes, modified it to perform much faster using SIMD instructions and OpenMP.
- **CS 188 - *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence*:**
    - Pacman (*Python*):
        - Search: Pacman agent who finds paths through a maze world, both to reach particular location and to collect food efficiently.
            - Depth-First-Search, Breath-First-Search, Uniform Cost Search, A* Search algorithms along with some heuristic designs.
        - Multi-agent Search: Agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts.
            - Reflex agent and adversarial search agent who act optimally at given environment. (minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectiminimax algorithms)
        - Reinforcement Learning: Agents who learns how to act optimally with maximum rewards possible. (Value iteration and Q-learning algorithms.)
        - Bayes' Nets: Inference algorithms for Bayes Nets, specifically variable elimination and valu-of-perfect-information computation for agents to act optimally.
    - Machine Learning (*Python*):
        - Neural networks to classify handwritten digits, approximate some math functions such as trigonometry functions, perform deep Q-learning, and language identification.
- **CS 186 - *Introduction to Database Systems*:**
    - To be updated...
- More projects are coming...
